This project is used to control a solar inverters "Azur Independa".

This inverters were originally controlled by an own controller box.

The inverters were originally connected to lead acid batteries.

After my batteries died I have replaced them with a LiFePo4 Pack from Basengreen and a new software has to control the inverters as the original controller does not work with LiFePo4.

This was a quick and dirty project and many things are hardcoded in to code, but it works fine for me so faar.
